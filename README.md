# Foundation Tasks (v4.0) 3/6/2015

Nicholas Ventimiglia | AvariceOnline.com

## Unity3d Async Task Library

A utility library inspired by Task Parallelism Library, but made especially for Unity3d. Supports running and waiting on actions running in background threads. Supports running and waiting on coroutines. Supports coroutines with return results and exception messages !

 - Tasks support running on the main thread, background thread or as coroutines.
 - Tasks support return results. 
 - Wait for your tasks to complete in a coroutine or as a thread blocking call
 - Grace full exception handling (IsFaulted ?)

## Structure

- The "Foundation Tasks" folder contains a very basic example
- The "Foundation.Tasks" folder contains the plugin source code

## Setup

Drop the Foundation.Tasks.dll into your plug in folder


## Use

####Run
Tasks have a static factory "Run" method which will create a new task in that started state. This method has overrides for every conscionable situation.
You may also construct a task yourself and start it yourself.

####Strategy
Tasks have a number of strategies you can choose from.
 - Run in Background thread
 - Run in a coroutine via the task manager
 - Run in the current thread
 - Run on the main thread
 - Run a custom strategy. This is useful if you want to manually set the task's state, result and exception. 
  
####ContinueWith
ContinueWith is a extension method which allows you to execute a piece of code after the task is complete. This is useful with the coroutine strategy
as a way to populate the Result property. You may chain multiple continue with's

####Wait
- Wait will hault the thread until the task is complete. Only call this from a background thread. DO NO CALL THIS IN THE MAIN THREAD.
- WaitRoutine is a Coroutine that you may start. This routine will continue until the task is complete. Use this in the main thread.

####TaskManager
The task manager is a monobehaviours which interfaces the task's with unity. It is responsible for executing on the main thread and running coroutines.
You dont need to add this object to your scene, it is added automatically.

## Debugging

I have a static flag to disable background threads. This will cause Unity
to act funny (pausing the main thread), but, you will get a complete stack trace.

````c#
    /// <summary>
    /// Forces use of a single thread for debugging
    /// </summary>
    public static bool DisableMultiThread = false;

    /// <summary>
    /// Logs Exceptions
    /// </summary>
    public static bool LogErrors = false;

````

## Examples

```c#
		IEnumerator HowToUse()
        {
			// Pass in an action, function, method or coroutine
            var task = Task.Run(() =>
            {
				//Debug.Log does not work in
                Debug.Log("Sleeping...");
                Task.Delay(2000);
                Debug.Log("Slept");
            });

			// wait for it
            yield return StartCoroutine(task.WaitRoutine());

			// check exceptions
			if(task.IsFaulted)
				Debug.LogException(task.Exception)

			//Valid if this method returned something
			//var result = task.Result;

        }
		
		// Run a Task on the main thread
        Task.RunOnMain(() =>
        {
            Debug.Log("Sleeping...");
            Task.Delay(2000);
            Debug.Log("Slept");
        });
        

		// Run a Task on a background thread
        Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Debug.Log("("Sleeping...");
            Task.Delay(2000);
            Debug.Log("("Slept");
        });
        

		// Run a coroutine as a tasks
		Task.RunCoroutine(RoutineFunction());
        
		IEnumerator RoutineFunction(){
			Debug.LogOutput("Sleeping...");
			yield return new WaitForSeconds(2);
			Debug.LogOutput("Slept");
		}
       
		// Run a background task that then runs a task on the main thread
		Task.Run(() =>
		{
			Debug.Log("("Thread A Sleep");
			Task.Delay(2000);
			Debug.Log("("Thread A Awake");
			Task.RunOnMain(() =>
			{
				Debug.Log("Sleeping...");
				Task.Delay(2000);
				Debug.Log("Slept");
			});
			Debug.Log("Thread B By");
		});     
		
		// Run a coroutine with a task as the parameter        
		Task.RunCoroutine<string>(RoutineFunction());
        
		IEnumerator RoutineFunction(Task<string> task){
			// manually set State / Exception / Result
		}
   
```
